== How to test changes in shell-ui?
[sidebar]
*shell-ui*, testing, core-apps

If you want to test changes to shell-ui, you can build it locally as a container for your docker-compose (inside your onecx-local-env).
Context should lead to your cloned repository, docker will then take care of building the image and running it.

.How it can look in your docker-compose.yaml
[example]
[source,yaml]
----
 onecx-shell-ui:   
    # image: localhost/onecx-shell-ui:latest
    build:
      context: /path/to/onecx-shell-ui
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
----
IMPORTANT: Change back to image after finishing development, so you use the public one again
